# Development role handlers for service management
#
# Handlers are triggered by tasks using the notify directive.
# They only run if the task that notified them reported a change.
# This ensures services are only restarted when necessary, reducing downtime.

- name: Restart docker service
  tags: system,docker
  systemd:
    name: docker

  listen: "restart docker"
  # Triggered when: Docker daemon configuration files are modified
  # Used by: docker.yml tasks that modify daemon.json or other config files
  # Note: In WSL, this handler is skipped (Docker Desktop for Windows should be used)
  # Example use: notify this handler after copying docker daemon.json to trigger reload
